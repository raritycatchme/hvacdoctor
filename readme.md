<h1>HVAC doctor</h1>

<H5>An unoffical project for ecobee by Jason Harder </h6> 

HVAC Doctor is a program that will take reports from your ecobee thermostat (downloaded through your account at ecobee.com) and assess what could be happening with it (as we would)

Right now these docs are mainly a to do list 

<ol>
  <h6>1. Function calculations (how do we determine what is what in reports?) </h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Overheating HVAC. </li>
      <li>Sensors not reporting. </li>
      <li>Wall drafts </li> 
      <li>Heat failing (HVAC or ecobee indeterminable here) </li>
    </ol>
   <h6>2. Things you should confirm (based on results) 
   <h6>3. Spreadsheet formatting choices (based on what was encouraged in lunch and learns) </h6> 
   
   <h6>4. Running HVAC doctor locally </h6>
You can git clone on your terminal and then run NPM start in the project root folder.    
   
   <h6>5. Contributing </h6> 

My development process follows the Gitflow workflow outline(link with details here : https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) 

Any and all improvement to the program is encouraged - just submit a pull request with changes for review and I will assess if that is the best course of action. If you see a bug , please create an issue on Github with a test to show how it fails (or send the test with the fix) . I will fix it (to the best of my ability) or integrate your changes.
